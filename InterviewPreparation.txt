Generic C++ Study Part
1.What is Vtable and Vptr how it works?
2.What is virtual destructor, why it is used?
3.Why virtual function or pure virtual fuction is used?
4.Can we use Virtual destructor and virtual contructor?
5. Difference betw pointer and refernce and why ref is used?
  -> Reference is just another name for memory location of variable so no additional memory space is used by referennce
  -> Pointer is separate memory location which holds address of memory location of variable
  -> reference cannot be NULL as it has to be assigned value at the time of declaration or before using it so no segmentation fault.
  -> pointers can be NULL
  -> Whenever reassignment is needed prefer pointer else use reference as reassignment of reference to other variable is not possible.
6.Singleton design pattern?
7.Static key word in C++?
8.what compiler provides by default in C++?
8.Factory design patterns
9.Proxy
10.Copy constructor and assignment operator
11. what IPC u used between chips?
12. Observer pattern

TTL JV 1 interview

1.What Producto platform u used?
 HW arm chip AP PP
  SW Linux
2.For arm chip how build on your m/c for HW?
-  Cross complilation using Vmware and on server jenkins
2.How PP AA chips communicate ?
Dbus
3.How service carsh debugging take place?
coredump and logging
4.How to test if target maching is not availabel?
Simulation ,  
5.How to do developer testing for fuction you were written?
UTC, manually test, automation.
6.How to debug in production enviromrnt if logs are disable?
Via Diagnostic mode to get critical data from ECU clustuer?
7.How to ensure quality of code.
Use static code analyzer like Parasoft
Misra compilance
Valgrind - memory likes
8.Code review checklist
Is UTC doe?
Is Developer test done on simulation + HW
Is pear reviews doen with in team
All coding guideline followed
Misra compalnce
Static code parasof and valagring report available
Test reports and flow diag attached
Any impediance or viewers ?
9.What challagening problem you solved
??HMI perfromance issue

10.Ledership experience to handle team?
